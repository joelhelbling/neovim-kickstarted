# neovim-kickstarted
My neovim config, starting from [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

_Note: this is not a fork, it's just starting from a copy/paste of the above project's `init.lua` --just the way TJ said to do it!_

## my notes from [Effective Neovim: Instant IDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stqUbv-5u2s)
- `<space>sf` to _fuzzy_ search files
- `:Telescope keymaps` to search for keymappings and see their definitions
- `:Mason` to pick from all the available language servers
